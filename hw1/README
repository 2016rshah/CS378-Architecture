Making Your Own Branch Predictor
--------------------------------
In order to create your own branch predictor, take a look at branch/example.bpred.
You can edit this file directly and rename it when you submit it, or you may create 
new ones. Any branch predictors you write must end in the suffix ".bpred".

Running Your Branch Predictor
-----------------------------
To evaluate how well your branch predictor performs, run the script "run_bp.sh" like so,

    ./run_bp.sh my_branch_predictor

where my_branch_predictor is the name of the code you want to run, excluding the ".bpred"
suffix. The script will compile the simulator and run it, printing out the results after.
Results are stored in the "output" folder, and can be printed neatly by running the 
print_results scripts ("./print_results.py").

Tips
----
You must be on a UTCS lab machine to run your code.

If your text editor of choice doesn't seem to recognize the .bpred file as code,
you'll have to change this. 
For vim, you need to add this line to your .vimrc file:
    au BufNewFile,BufReadPost *.bpred set syntax=cpp
